function merge_spikes_sessions(dir1, dir2, ch_list, out_dir)
% merge_spikes_sessions    Merge the spikes recorded in two sessions.
%                          dir1 will be followed in time by dir2.  If the
%                          sampling frequencies in the two sessions were
%                          not identical, dir2 will be interpolated to
%                          match dir1.
