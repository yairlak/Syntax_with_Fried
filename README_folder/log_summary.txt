- Added to Code/Spike_sorting/NeurlaynxPipeline/ncs2mat.m and ncsMIC2mat.m
- Added Code/Utils/ with scripts needed for, e.g., spike sorting pipeline
- Spike sorting with Combinato was done for subjects 479_11, 482, 493, 502 and 505. WITHOUT manual fine-tuning. The multi-process pipeline, using jobs was used for that. See spike_sorting pipeline file for details.
- Patient 493 may have a bad manually synch'ed log. Ariel should fix it.
- Patient 502 has an error when launching generate_epochs script about repeated events (check log). 

- epochs were generated for subject 479_11, 482 and 505, for MACRO, MICRO and SPIKES.
- in Bash/, parallel_generate for micro high gamma was updated (minor issues). currently only generate micro epochs can be run on Alambic, but the output is of zero size (not clear why). Until fixed, use parallel_is153802 instead.
- Macro and spike epochstfr generation is currently not paralelized. Epochstfr are generated sequentially by launching the script for each patient separately. 
- Code/Main/plot_rasters.py was changed to be compatible with epochstfr and not epochs (h5 instead of fif files, respectively, in Data/patient/Epochs)

UCLA comfirmed patient 479 GA3-RIFAC1.ncs is missing
UCLA confirmed patient 482 RAH4.ncs is missing

- Epochs: both -epo.fif and -tfr.h5 are generated for SPIKES. fif is used for raster plots, whereas tfr.h5 are used for decoding (smoothed rasters)
- Manual spike sorting 482 (completed)
- Manual spike sorting 479_11 (up to CSC15 including)

- Started working on Main/plot_comparison.py
# -----------------------------------
2019Sep14-15
- Finished first version of plot_comparison. Run on cluster from Bash/Plotting, per patient. For each probe, it plots ERPs for both micro and macro contacts, together with decoding, and the same for spikes.

- Parsed auditory stimuli with Prosodylab-Aligner (https://github.com/prosodylab/Prosodylab-Aligner; Gorman, Kyle, Jonathan Howell and Michael Wagner. 2011. Prosodylab-Aligner: A Tool for Forced Alignment of Laboratory Speech. Canadian Acoustics)
- Path to forced alignment between wav and txt files: /home/yl254115/Projects/Prosodylab-Aligner/
- To run alignment for english stimuli: 'python3 -m aligner -r eng.zip -a ../intracranial/single_unit/Syntax_with_Fried/Paradigm/Stimuli/Audio/normalized/resampled_16k/ -d eng.dict -V'
- This will generate TextGrid (praat) files in the folder of the wav files (resampled_16k) in this case. 
- Finally, to generate figures based on the TextGrid and corresponding wav files, run: Code/Main/plot_audio_stimuli_with_alignments.py
- NOTE that I've installed prosodylab-aligner on my LAPTOP only (is154103) and not on mystation (is153802). 

2020Jan29
- Bug fixed in Code/Main/functions/read_log.. regarding the generation of the metadata with phone info. word_position, sentence_position etc were not int but str, so query didn't work. 
- patient 513: logs with phone onsets generated. There was a problem with log of block #3. TODO: see with Ariel.
- patient 515: logs with phone onsets generated. There was a problem with logs of visual blocks #1,5. TODO: see with Ariel.

2020Feb21
- Auto clustering of patients 513 and 515
- I've spended a lot of time to understand why css-combine gave an error (based of the session-manager turned to be a None). It was fixed by making sure that all css-* scripts use python2. For example, make sure that: /neurospin/unicog/protocols/intracranial/combinato/css-cluster, has #!/usr/bin/env python2 at the first line. 
- Patient 513 - manual spike sorting up to channel 6 (included)
