Steps to follow with a new patient data:

1. to list files on box: 'rclone lsd box:'

2. Put the raw files in 'Raw' subfolder of patient folder. Make sure that only a single event file (nev) exist (the one with the larger file size)

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!! The next step runs only on my laptop, under 'conda activate Syntax_with_Fried' and with python2.7
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3. To get time0 and timeEnd, run read_nev_files.py e.g. 'python2.7 read_nev_files.py patient_487'. Add these times to 'load_setting_params'

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!!! make sure before the next step that clock_sync was run on log files - see (README.yair). Then all logs are in the following format 'events_log_in_cheetah_clock_part*.log'
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11
4. Run generate_new_logs_from_onset_times.m on logs (this will add events for each word also for the auditory blocks based on word time onsets of the stimuli)

5. To transform raw to mat files, run: Spike_sorting/Neuralynx_pipeline/getRawCSC.m
matlab -nodisplay -nojvm 

6. Make sure the features.xls file is in /Paradigm

7. Make sure that in function/load_settings_params.py all is well defined (prefix of log files, e.g., mouse_cheatha..part1)

8. Run script from Bash/ folder.
